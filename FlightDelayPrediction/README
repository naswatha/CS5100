Steps to execute the different implementations in our project -

    1) Open terminal/command prompt
    2) Go to our project folder
    3) To run the different implementations -

        a) Run the following command for k nearest neighbors -
           make knn
        
        b) Run the following command for naive bayes classifier -
           make naive
        
        a) Run the following command for k nearest neighbors using WEKA -
           make wekaknn
        
        a) Run the following command for naive bayes classifier using WEKA -
           make wekanaive           
           
NOTE: On an average each implementation takes about 20 mins to run.
